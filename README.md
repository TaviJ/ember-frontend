# Ember

A full-stack journaling application built with React, Flask, and PostgreSQL that enables secure user authentication and structured daily logging with public/private visibility controls.
## Overview

Ember is a production-deployed full-stack web application designed to demonstrate secure authentication, RESTful API design, relational data modeling, and cloud deployment practices.

Users can:

- Register and authenticate via JWT

- Create, update, and delete journal entries

- Control visibility (private vs public)

- View a global public feed

- Access a personalized dashboard

This project emphasizes clean architecture, production debugging, and real-world deployment workflows.
